GAME RULES:

- This game involves two players who take turns.
- During a turn, a player may roll multiple times, with each roll's outcome being added to their score for that round.
- However, should a player roll a 1, they forfeit their score for that round and the next player takes their turn.
- A player has the option to 'Hold the game', which transfers their round's score to their overall score, and then it is the other player's turn.
- The winner goes to the first player who amasses an overall score of 50 points.
