GAME RULES:

- This game involves two participants who take turns.
- During a turn, a participant may roll a dice multiple times, with each roll's outcome being added to their score for that round.
- However, should a participant roll a 1, they forfeit their score for that round and the next participant takes their turn.
- A participant has the option to 'Hold', which transfers their round's score to their overall score, and then it is the other participant's turn.
- The winner goes to the first participant who amasses an overall score of 50 points.
